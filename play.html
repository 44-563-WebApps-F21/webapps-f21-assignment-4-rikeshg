<h2>The Duchess of Padua</h2>
<h3>ACT IV._The Hall of Justice_ (31 _minutes_)  _the walls are hung with stamped grey velvet_:

    moulding_: _a canopy of white satin flowered with gold is set for the
    Duchess_: _below it a long bench with red cloth for the Judges_: _below
    that a table for the clerks of the court.  Two soldiers stand on each
    side of the canopy_, _and two soldiers guard the door_; _the citizens
    have some of them collected in the Court_; _others are coming in greeting
    one another_; _two tipstaffs in violet keep order with long white wands_.

        FIRST CITIZEN<br>

        Good morrow, neighbour Anthony.<br>
     
     SECOND CITIZEN<br>
     
        Good morrow, neighbour Dominick.<br>
     
     FIRST CITIZEN<br>
     
        This is a strange day for Padua, is it not?—the Duke being dead.<br>
     
     SECOND CITIZEN<br>
     
        I tell you, neighbour Dominick, I have not known such a day since the
        last Duke died.<br>
     
     FIRST CITIZEN<br>
     
        They will try him first, and sentence him afterwards, will they not,
        neighbour Anthony?<br>
     
     SECOND CITIZEN<br>
     
        Nay, for he might ’scape his punishment then; but they will condemn
        him first so that he gets his deserts, and give him trial afterwards
        so that no injustice is done.<br>
     
     FIRST CITIZEN<br>
     
        Well, well, it will go hard with him I doubt not.<br>
     
     SECOND CITIZEN<br>
     
        Surely it is a grievous thing to shed a Duke’s blood.<br>
     
     THIRD CITIZEN<br>
     
        They say a Duke has blue blood.<br>
