<h2>The Duchess of Padua</h2>
<h3>ACT IV._The Hall of Justice_ (31 _minutes_)  _the walls are hung with stamped grey velvet_:
    _above the hangings the wall is red_, _and gilt symbolical figures bear
    up the roof_, _which is made of red beams with grey soffits and
    moulding_: _a canopy of white satin flowered with gold is set for the
    Duchess_: _below it a long bench with red cloth for the Judges_: _below
    that a table for the clerks of the court.  Two soldiers stand on each
    side of the canopy_, _and two soldiers guard the door_; _the citizens
    have some of them collected in the Court_; _others are coming in greeting
    one another_; _two tipstaffs in violet keep order with long white wands_.

    <h5 class="firstcitizen"> FIRST CITIZEN</h5>
     
        <p id="speech">This is a strange day for Padua, is it not?—the Duke being dead.</p>
     
    <h5 class="secondcitizen">SECOND CITIZEN</h5>
     
       <p id="speech">I tell you, neighbour Dominick, I have not known such a day since the
        last Duke died.</p>
     
    <h5 class="firstcitizen">FIRST CITIZEN</h5>
     
        <p id="speech">They will try him first, and sentence him afterwards, will they not,
         neighbour Anthony?</p>
     
    <h5 class="secondcitizen">SECOND CITIZEN</h5>
     
       <p id="speech">Nay, for he might ’scape his punishment then; but they will condemn
        him first so that he gets his deserts, and give him trial afterwards
        so that no injustice is done.</p>
     
     <h5 class="secondcitizen">SECOND CITIZEN</h5>
     
        <p id="speech">Well, well, it will go hard with him I doubt not.</p>
     
    <h5  class="secondcitizen">SECOND CITIZEN</h5>
     
        <p id="speech">Surely it is a grievous thing to shed a Duke’s blood.</p>
     
    <h5  class="thirdcitizen">THIRD CITIZEN</h5>
     
        <p id="speech">They say a Duke has blue blood</p>
